# ui-challange

Finished the task in 3 hours time.

I have started task with mobile-first approach and eventually build it.

there are some parts which I was not able to do due to time contraint is : 

- phone number should display for tablet and desktop.
- Nested items to show in side the table for desktop.
- exact icon for watch and download, I was not able to find due to time issue.

Would love to extend the project if given chance.

Let me know if any questions are there.
